MSDB
====

Lightweight database system.

My first program I'm entering into the developing world. I plan on this being a lasting project.

MSDB is a lightweight database system using the file type .msdb.

It's meant to be used for storing domestic data and help out, e.g jobs/chores, homework, meetings and is meant to help
people out in the real world. Currently, files can only be read by right-clicking and opening with a text editor and
the same with editing, but creating databases (and soon tables) has a system for doing that without going through
copying and pasting.
